🛠️ Tools Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔧 Data Cleaning
Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
Dropped irrelevant columns
Converted categorical variables
Checked data types and consistency

📊 EDA Highlights
Survival analysis by gender, class, and age
Fare vs survival relationship
Family size impact on survival
Correlation analysis using heatmaps

🔍 Key Insights
Females had higher survival rates
1st class passengers survived more
Children had better survival chances
Higher fares correlated with higher survival probability

🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning and EDA in uncovering meaningful insights from real-world datasets.
